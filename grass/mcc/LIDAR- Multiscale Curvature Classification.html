Code for running MCC is currently implemented in Arc Macro Language (AML) for workstation Arc/Info. Work is currently underway to translate the code to IDL. For information regarding this algorithm please contact Jeffrey S. Evans . Landscape EcologistUSFS -- Rocky Mt.

Unfortunately the majority of available algorithms are proprietary and only available in commercial software or through .in-house. vendor processing at considerable cost. A large portion of LiDAR acquisition cost is incurred during post-processing to separate ground from non-ground returns. This is in large part due to the manual editing required to "clean up" the surface and the need to reclaim software development or purchase costs. Ground information is often delivered in the form of gridded raster or normally spaced point data. Both of these deliverables generalize the data, discarding the original spatial precision and volume of ground returns. The original volume of ground returns is needed to build relationships between ground and vegetation returns. If an appropriate volume of ground returns is retained, then the resulting interpolated surface will match the scale and precision of the original LiDAR point cloud reducing bias and error in the derived heights. A simple differencing of the interpolated ground height surface from the raw LiDAR elevations will provide the vegetation height at each point while preserving density relationships related to vegetation cover, such as the proportion of non-ground to ground returns. Example of PCF model in high biomass forest in northern Idaho across 3 model loops. References: J.

Four criteria were applied in developing the PCF algorithm. The first was flexibility across different LiDAR data formats. The PCF algorithm requires only the X and Y coordinates and elevation (Z) values as inputs, the three most basic parameters common to all LiDAR datasets. The second criterion was simplicity in model parameters. Too numerous, or overly complex model parameters can introduce subjectivity or result in lack of repeatability, however the only required input parameters to the PCF algorithm are the nominal post spacing and the curvature coefficient. The third criterion was that the model be fully automated; i.e., the user need not intervene during the filtering process, which can also introduce subjectivity. Finally, the filtering algorithm should preclude or minimize the need for post-processing, which can be a very time-consuming and subjective process. In summary, the PCF algorithm was designed to objectively, reliably, and repeatability identify ground returns with minimal to no need for manual editing, from any discrete return LiDAR dataset acquired over a forested environment. Ground information is often delivered in the form of gridded raster or normally spaced point data. Both of these deliverables generalize the data, discarding the original spatial precision and volume of ground returns. The original volume of ground returns is needed to build relationships between ground and vegetation returns. If an appropriate volume of ground returns is retained, then the resulting interpolated surface will match the scale and precision of the original LiDAR point cloud reducing bias and error in the derived heights. A simple differencing of the interpolated ground height surface from the raw LiDAR elevations will provide the vegetation height at each point while preserving density relationships related to vegetation cover, such as the proportion of non-ground to ground returns. PCF <INCOVER> <OUTCOVER> <ELEVATION ITEM> <POST-SPACING>        {CURVATURE} {COLUMNS-X} {COLUMNS-Y}INCOVER - Point coverage of LiDAR point cloudOUTCOVER - Filtered coverage of LiDAR ground returnsELEVATION ITEM - Info item in LiDAR-coverage, containing elevation valuePOSTSPACING - Nominal post spacing of LiDAR dataCURVATURE - Coefficient defining curvature thresholdCOLUMNS-X - Number of divisions on X plane                               COLUMNS-Y - Number of divisions on Y plane                                 The curvature coefficient for ~2 meter postspacing can be set to 0.2 - 0.3, for < 1 meter postspacing depending on the density of the canopy. I have had to set it as small as 0.7. This may require some trial and error to find the ideal starting value. The scale and curvature coefficients are defined automatically in subsequent model loops, thus requiring only a starting value. The scale parameter is initially derived from the nominal postspacing. The COLUMNS-X and COLUMNS-Y arguments are for an automatic tiling scheme within the model. The tiling is corrected for edge effect and is meant to speed up processing and accommodate the limit of samples the spline can fit (300,000 point max). The best way to determine these arguments is to take the total number of points in a given coverage and figure out the number of tiles you need to have <= 300,000 points per tile. The AML merges the tiles so the final coverage is a new coverage containing the filtered ground returns. The model assumes an unfiltered point cloud. If the LiDAR data has been filtered by the vendor is gridded, or separated into a separate dataset(s), PCF will not work. The model is set up as an ATOOL. To install place in the $ARCHOME\atool\arc directory it will behave like a native ArcInfo command. An example of this path, depending on your install, is: C:\arcgis\arcexe9x\atool\arc DOWNLOAD MCC.AML/* Purpose: Multiscale Curvature Classification for classification of ground returns/* with an automated tiling function.
